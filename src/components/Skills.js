                   Over the past years, I've gained experience in web development, including working as a
                   freelancer and working for Moravio, a web development company, for more than four years.
                   My time in the industry has exposed me to a wide range of projects.

                   As a developer, I pride myself on my ability to write clean, efficient, and maintainable code.
                   I'm well-versed in various programming languages and technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and PHP.
                   Additionally, I'm always eager to learn new skills and stay up-to-date with the latest trends in the industry.

                   Other than programming skills, I have a strong grasp of soft skills, Scrum, Agile development, and Jira.
                   Effective communication, teamwork, and time management allow me to collaborate efficiently, while Scrum
                   and Agile methodologies provide a framework for organizing projects. I use Jira to manage workflows and
                   track progress, leading to successful outcomes.
